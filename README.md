# Sentiment Analysis for Text Classification

This project focuses on analyzing text data to classify sentiments (e.g., positive, negative, neutral) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaned and tokenized raw text data to prepare it for machine learning models.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Transformed textual data into numerical representations using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency.
- **Model Training**: Trained multiple machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines, to classify sentiments.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluated models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization**: Created visual representations of feature importance and model performance for better interpretability.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Removed stop words, punctuation, and special characters.
   - Tokenized text data and converted it into a usable format.
2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Applied TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction.
3. **Model Training**:
   - Implemented and fine-tuned various models like Logistic Regression and SVM.
4. **Evaluation**:
   - Compared models' performance using evaluation metrics and visualized results.

## Technologies and Tools
