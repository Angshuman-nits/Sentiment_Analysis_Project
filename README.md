# Sentiment Analysis for Text Classification

This project focuses on analyzing text data to classify sentiments (e.g., positive, negative, neutral) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaned and tokenized raw text data to prepare it for machine learning models.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Transformed textual data into numerical representations using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency.
- **Model Training**: Trained multiple machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines, to classify sentiments.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluated models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization**: Created visual representations of feature importance and model performance for better interpretability.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Removed stop words, punctuation, and special characters.
   - Tokenized text data and converted it into a usable format.
2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Applied TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction.
3. **Model Training**:
   - Implemented and fine-tuned various models like Logistic Regression and SVM.
4. **Evaluation**:
   - Compared models' performance using evaluation metrics and visualized results.

## Technologies and Tools

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - `Scikit-learn`: For machine learning models and evaluation.
  - `Pandas` and `NumPy`: For data manipulation and numerical operations.
  - `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`: For data visualization.
  - `NLTK`: For text preprocessing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python (>= 3.8) installed. Install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Angshuman-nits/SentimentAnalysis_Project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd SentimentAnalysis_Project
   ```

### Running the Project

1. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook SentimentAnalysis_Project.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train models, and evaluate their performance.

## Results

- Achieved [mention accuracy or F1-score]% accuracy on the sentiment classification task.
- Identified key features influencing model predictions using TF-IDF.
